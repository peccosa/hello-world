# hello-world


Hi every1 ^^

My name is Angela and I am an illustrator and concept artist. 
I make manga-style illustrations and (soon) will be making comics and long stories.
You can check out my portfolio at behance.net/peccosa

I joined GitHub because I am training to become a web dev. Besides art, I love to code. 

Anyways, nice to meet you :)
